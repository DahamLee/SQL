FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```
```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
```
```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.customername, Shippers.shippername
FROM ((Orders INNER JOIN Shippers On Orders.ShipperID=Shippers.shipperID) 
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.customerID=Customers.customerID)
ORDER BY OrderID;
```

### -Left Join

```
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```

### -Right Join
```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID; 
```

### -Full outer join

```
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```


### SQL UNION

>Similar with using DISTINCT

```
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```

>UNION ALL (get all data even they are repeated)

```
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```

### SQL GROUP BY
```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;
```
```
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;
```

### SQL HAVING
> Having is like IF

```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
```
```
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM (Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;
```

### SQL EXISTS ????
```
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE SupplierId = Suppliers.supplierId AND Price < 20);
```
```
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE SupplierId = Suppliers.supplierId AND Price = 22);
```

### SQL ANY and ALL ????

```
CREATE TABLE Persons
(
PersonID int,
LastName varchar(255),
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255)
);
```

## SQL Contraints
**SQL Contraints**
   
* NOT NULL: ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
* UNIQUE: ensures that all values in a column are different
* PRIMARY KEY: a combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
* FOREIGN KEY: uniquely identifies a row/record in another table
* CHECK: ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition
* DEFAULT: sets a default value for a column when no value is specified
* INDEX: use to create and retrieve data from the dataase very quickly

## -SQL NOT NULL
**when you put nothing it shows error**

```
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int
);
```

## -SQL CHECK
**put options in column**

```
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);
```

## -SQL DEFAULT
**put default value in column**

```
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Sandnes'
